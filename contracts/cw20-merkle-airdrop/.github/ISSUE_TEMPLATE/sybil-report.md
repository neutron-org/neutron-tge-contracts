# Related Addresses

<!--
Provide a list of related addresses that are currently eligible for Neutron’s initial airdrop. Together, these address must have owned more than 1,000,000 staked ATOM at block #12900000 and/or expressed more than 1,000,000 votes on Prop 72. Reports will be evaluated on a first-come, first-serve basis.
The eligible address list can be found here: `INSERT ELIGIBLE ADDRESS LIST` 

Example:
```
cosmos000000000000000000000000000000000001
cosmos000000000000000000000000000000000002
cosmos000000000000000000000000000000000003
cosmos000000000000000000000000000000000004
```

# Reasoning

<!--
Describe how the addresses are related with as much detail as possible.
Example:
```
```
-->

# Methodology

<!--
Explain the method used to discover the addresses and provide proof that they are all related and likely operated by a single individual/entity with a high degree of probability. Self-reports can simply link to txs that include "NTRN Self-Report" as a memo from each self-reported account.
The methodology should be easy to verify or the report will not be considered. Please, also include links to any additional materials you’d like to provide like a github repo containing the script used to uncover the reported addresses.
Example:
```
The reported addresses were discovered by building a dataset of addresses on 5 Cosmos chains and their interactions. An algorithm was used to identify repeating patterns in the order of those interactions and form clusters. Clusters were selected based on the number of interactions and proximity in transfer amounts, then checked against the list of eligible addresses.
