# Lockdrop

The lockdrop contract allows users to lock any of the supported Terraswap LP tokens locked for a selected duration against which they will receive ASTRO tokens pro-rata to their weighted share of the LP tokens to the total deposited LP tokens for that particular pool in the contract.

- Upon lockup expiration, users will receive Astroport LP tokens on an equivalent weight basis as per their initial Terraswap LP token deposits.

Note - Users can open muliple lockup positions with different lockup duration for each LP Token pool
