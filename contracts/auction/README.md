# LP Bootstrap via Auction Contract

The LP Bootstrap via auction contract facilitates cNTRN-NATIVE Neutron pool initialization during the protocol launch.

**Phase 1 :: Bootstrapping cNTRN and NATIVE Side of the LP Pool**

- Airdrop recipients and lockdrop participants can delegate part / all of their cNTRN rewards to the auction contract.
- Any user can deposit UST directly to the auction contract to participate in the LP bootstrap auction.
- Both UST deposited & cNTRN delegated (if any) balances are used to calculate user's LP token shares and additional cNTRN incentives that he will receive for participating in the auction.

**Phase 2 :: Post cNTRN-NATIVE Pool initialization**

- cNTRN reward withdrawals from lockdrop & airdrop contracts are enabled during the cNTRN-UST Pool initializaiton.
- cNTRN-UST LP tokens are staked with the generator contract, with LP Staking rewards allocated equally among the users based on their % LP share
- cNTRN incentives are directly claimable
- Users cNTRN-UST LP shares are vested linearly on a 90 day period
