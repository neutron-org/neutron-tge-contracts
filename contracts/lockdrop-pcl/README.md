# Lockdrop for PCL pools

A shortened, simplified copy of the [Neutron lockdrop contract](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron-tge-contracts/tree/main/contracts/lockdrop) extended with an entry point to receive lockdrop liquidity from the original contract in order to move it from XYK pools to PCL ones.
